# Remote Access (Relay Mode)

Agent Monitor runs on the machine where your agents execute (the **agent machine**). Since this machine is often not publicly accessible, a **relay server** on a public machine forwards all traffic through a WebSocket tunnel.

```
Phone / Laptop ──HTTP──▶ Public Server (Relay :3457) ◀──WS tunnel──  Agent Machine (:3456)
```

## Architecture Overview

| Component | Where it runs | What it does |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **AgentMonitor server** | Agent machine (local) | Manages agents, spawns CLI processes |
| **Relay server** | Public server | Serves dashboard, forwards API + Socket.IO via tunnel |
| **TunnelClient** | Agent machine (local) | Connects outbound to relay, handles forwarded requests |
| **Dashboard** | Browser (any device) | Accesses relay URL — identical to local mode |

The tunnel is **outbound-only** from the agent machine — no inbound ports needed.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the relay to a public server

```bash
# From the AgentMonitor repo on any machine with SSH access:
bash relay/scripts/deploy.sh <your-secret-token> <your-dashboard-password>
```

This builds the client + relay, rsyncs to the server, installs deps, and starts with pm2.

> **Important:** Set a dashboard password to protect your relay from unauthorized access. Without it, anyone who knows the URL can control your agents.

### 2. Start AgentMonitor with tunnel enabled

```bash
RELAY_URL=ws://<public-ip>:3457/tunnel \
RELAY_TOKEN=<your-secret-token> \
npx tsx server/src/index.ts
```

You'll see:
```
[Tunnel] Connecting to ws://<public-ip>:3457/tunnel...
[Tunnel] Connected, authenticating...
[Tunnel] Authenticated successfully
Agent Monitor server running on port 3456
```

### 3. Open the dashboard from any device

Navigate to `http://<public-ip>:3457` in any browser.

## Switching Agent Machines

You can run AgentMonitor on **any machine** — a desktop, a cloud VM, a lab server — as long as it can reach the relay. The relay doesn't care which machine connects; it just forwards traffic to whoever is currently tunneled in.

### What you need on the new machine

1. **Clone the repo** and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> && cd AgentMonitor
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```

2. **Install agent CLIs** that you plan to use:
   ```bash
   # Claude Code
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

   # Codex (optional)
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   ```

3. **Copy your `.env` file** (or set environment variables):
   ```bash
   # Required for relay mode:
   RELAY_URL=ws://<public-ip>:3457/tunnel
   RELAY_TOKEN=<same-token-as-relay>

   # Optional (same as before):
   # SMTP_*, TWILIO_*, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, CLAUDE_BIN, CODEX_BIN
   ```

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server && npx tsx src/index.ts
   ```

That's it. The relay automatically accepts the new tunnel connection (replacing any previous one). The dashboard at `http://<public-ip>:3457` now talks to the new machine.

### Important notes

- **One agent machine at a time.** The relay accepts one tunnel connection. If a new machine connects, it replaces the old one.
- **Agent data is local.** Each machine has its own `server/data/` directory with agent history, templates, and settings. These do not sync between machines.
- **Sessions are local.** Claude Code sessions (for `--resume`) live on the machine where they were created.
- **Git repos must exist locally.** The working directory you specify when creating an agent must exist on the agent machine.

### Migrating agent data between machines

If you want to preserve agents, templates, and settings:

```bash
# On the old machine:
rsync -avz server/data/ new-machine:/path/to/AgentMonitor/server/data/
```

## Relay Server Management

### Check relay status

```bash
curl http://<public-ip>:3457/api/relay/status
# {"tunnelConnected":true,"uptime":3600}
```

### View relay logs

```bash
ssh your-server "pm2 logs agentmonitor-relay --lines 20"
```

### Restart the relay

```bash
ssh your-server "pm2 restart agentmonitor-relay"
```

### Redeploy after code changes

```bash
bash relay/scripts/deploy.sh <your-token>
```

### Change the relay token

1. Stop the relay: `ssh your-server "pm2 delete agentmonitor-relay"`
2. Redeploy with new token: `bash relay/scripts/deploy.sh <new-token>`
3. Update `RELAY_TOKEN` on the agent machine and restart

## Configuration Reference

### Agent machine environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RELAY_URL` | Yes | WebSocket URL of relay (e.g., `ws://1.2.3.4:3457/tunnel`) |
| `RELAY_TOKEN` | Yes | Shared secret — must match relay |
| `PORT` | No | Local server port (default: `3456`) |

### Relay server environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RELAY_TOKEN` | Yes | Shared secret — must match agent machine |
| `RELAY_PASSWORD` | Recommended | Dashboard login password (if empty, no auth) |
| `RELAY_PORT` | No | Port relay listens on (default: `3457`) |
| `RELAY_DOMAIN` | No | Domain name if using nginx reverse proxy |

### Local-only mode

When `RELAY_URL` is **not set**, the server runs in local-only mode with zero relay overhead. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3456` directly.

## Tunnel Behavior

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Agent machine starts | Tunnel connects and authenticates automatically |
| Tunnel drops | Auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (5s → 60s) |
| Agent machine restarts | Tunnel reconnects; relay resumes forwarding |
| Relay restarts | Agent machine detects disconnect, reconnects when relay is back |
| Wrong token | Auth rejected, tunnel client stops (no retry) |
| API call while tunnel is down | Relay returns `502 Tunnel not connected` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Socket.IO connection errors in browser console

If you see repeated `[Socket] Connection error: websocket error` in the browser console when accessing the relay URL, this is typically caused by a session authentication issue. The relay uses `RELAY_PASSWORD` to protect the Socket.IO connection.

**How it works:** The client establishes Socket.IO using the `polling` transport first (which carries the auth cookie), then upgrades to WebSocket. Connecting directly via WebSocket without the polling handshake will fail auth and close with code 1006.

**Fix:** Ensure you are logged in at the relay URL (`/api/auth/login`) before the socket connects. Clearing cookies and logging in again usually resolves stale-session errors.

### Tunnel disconnects after agent machine restart

The agent machine must be started with `RELAY_URL` and `RELAY_TOKEN` set. After a restart, the tunnel reconnects automatically within a few seconds. Check `[Tunnel] Authenticated successfully` in the server log.

### PTY terminal not working via relay

The terminal requires the Socket.IO connection to be established. If the socket isn't connected (see above), terminal events won't be forwarded. Confirm the socket is connected (`[Socket] Connected: ...` in the browser console) before opening the terminal.

---

## Security Considerations

- The tunnel uses a **shared token** for authentication. Use a strong random token.
- The relay port is **open to the internet**. Consider using a firewall or nginx with HTTPS.
- **Set `RELAY_PASSWORD`** to enable login authentication. Without it, the dashboard is open to anyone.
- Sessions use JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies with 24-hour expiry.

### Adding nginx + HTTPS (optional)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name monitor.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/monitor.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/monitor.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3457;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

Set `RELAY_DOMAIN=monitor.yourdomain.com` to have the relay log the domain name on startup.
